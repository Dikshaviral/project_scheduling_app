# Project Scheduling App
A project scheduling app created using node.js, express and the Notion API. Data can be added through your notion account into the calender database created using the notion app, and the data will be read by the app and displayed. This way, while a number of people will be able to view the schedule and various task details, only authorized users can edit.
